# BussesAreUs

BussesAreUs is an Android Application that we created as our final project for the CPSC210: Software Construction course at UBC. 
The goal of this app is to help users locate bus stops in their the area, ther estimated arrival times, and the route taken by the bus. 
The application accomplishes this by extracting XML files that hold bus route data from the Translink API. 
The closest stop from the user is highlighted on the map and its location is displayed on the bottom of the screen. 
Finally, the user may click on any available bus stop to display the busses at that stop, arrival times, and their routes indicated by the different coloured lines.

The apk file is in out/production/BusesAreUs_Phase2.
